# PySimpleML

#### Description
This package gives the user the ability to train models from data in the form of a pandas dataframe. It provides 4 models:
- Artificial Neural Network
- K Nearest Neighbour Model
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

#### Background
**I am a noob.** So this is code is not the cleanest in the world by any means. This is just me getting my hands dirty. This package however, _is_ very handy to train a model in a jiffy in two lines of code. 

I'd love to hear any suggestions or corrections.

This package was made out of my new found interest in ML. I picked up an addiction of making these ML models form scratch after watching [Andrew Ng's ML Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vStJoetOxJg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI) on YouTube. 

#### Installation 
Terminal/CMD:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PySimpleML.git`

`pip install -e PySimpleML`
